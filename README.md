# Simple3DModeling
This is a 3D modeling software that I developed using Java. In the software you can create basic 3D models using rectangles. In it contains all of the basic elements of a CAD software which includes drawing, extruding, saving, and loading. It is inteded to be used as a stepping stone into more advanced pieces of CAD software.
